# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
This code is for an existing website for Horiseon Marketing, the objective of the project was to make the code more accessible and to improve it's search engine optimization (SEO). 
There was many different things I took away from this project, primariily the use of HTML semantics as well as keyboard accessibility and page navigation. 
This website should now be useable for any person and they will be able to navigate and understand it with ease.

## Usage

To Navigate the website with the keyboard, the TAB key can be used to scroll down the page and select different areas of the text. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

This project was worked on solely by me. The website https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp was used for guides and further research into HTML and CSS elements that needed adding and editing in the webpage.
